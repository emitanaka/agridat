\usage{data("lehmann.millet.uniformity")}
\format{
  A data frame with 396 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{year}}{year}
    \item{\code{plot}}{plot (row)}
    \item{\code{range}}{range (column)}

\details{

The 6th report has a map (only partially scanned in the pdf).
The ninth report, pages 1-10 has comments. Pages 36-39 have data: Table 1 has grain yield, table 2 total yield.

Experiment farm near Bangalore. The plots are 1/10 acre, each 50 links wide and 200 links long. [6th report, p. 2]

The season of 1906 was abnormally wet compared with 1905 and 1907. [9th report]
