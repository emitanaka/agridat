  Uniformity trial of cotton

\usage{data("love.cotton.uniformity")}
\format{
  A data frame with 170 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{row}
    \item{\code{col}}{column}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield}
  }
}
\details{
  Within each 100-foot row, the first 20 feet were harvested as a single plot,
  and then the rest of the row was harvested in 5-foot lengths.

  Crop location is unknown, but likely Southeast Asia given Love's work
  teaching in China. Date is likely about 1930-1932 based on the Cornell
  reference below.

  Possibly more information would be in the collected papers of Harry
  Love at Cornell:
