# Predictions for m1
lenght.m1.pvs = predict(m1, classify="trt", maxiter=1, trace=TRUE, sed=TRUE) 
lenght.m1.pvs$predictions

# Model comparison
info.crit.asreml(m0) # AIC = 134.9
info.crit.asreml(m1) # AIC = 128.3
reml.lrt.asreml(m1, m0, positive.zero=TRUE) # .001 significant
	
# Thus, a heterogeneous one-way anova is better fitting than homogeneous model
